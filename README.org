* caveman2-widgets 
** What is it
caveman2-widgets is an extension library to [[https://github.com/fukamachi/caveman][caveman2]]. It is influenced
by [[https://github.com/skypher/weblocks][Weblocks]] and introduces its widget system for the developer. By
only using its widget concept it does not control the developer as
much as Weblocks itself.

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(defclass <web> (<app>) ())
(defvar *web* (make-instance '<web>))
(clear-routing-rules *web*)
;; the above code would be in src/web.lisp if you use caveman's MAKE-PROJECT function.

(init-widgets *web*)
#+END_SRC
